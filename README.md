### WPF File Dialog Control

WPF file dialog control is a custom control that you can integrate into your WPF projects. 

It's essentially a copy of the windows explorer save/load dialog that you can use however you like in your project. For example, with this control you are now able to do a modal file dialog, or even embed the file dialog into a user control on your app.

I couldn't find anything else online that just copied the simplicity of the windows dialogs but allowed you to customize the style of it.

For some developers, the bare bones style on the dialog may be enough to use as-is, but the main idea behind this is for you to fork it (or just take it) and re-style it to fit your application's needs. This is why there is no styling done whatsoever in this control.

Please see the sample on how to use the control.

-- Note: The buttons and file location are not part of the Custom Control, they only exist to show you how to use it!


Thanks!
